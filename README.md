# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Generate-TV-Scripts
## Overview
In this project, I built an RNN based model which can generate Seinfeld TV series scripts based on the patterns it 
'learns' from the training data. My Recurrent Neural Network is trained on the part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) scripts from 9 seasons.
